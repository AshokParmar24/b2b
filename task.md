## Best Build Approach (Recommended Order)

1. **Project init first** — Get the scaffold running locally
2. **Models before UI** — Build all Mongoose schemas before any page
3. **Auth early** — NextAuth setup before admin/dashboard pages
4. **Admin Panel before Public** — Lets you add real data to test with
5. **Seed data early** — India master data + HSN codes needed for forms
6. **Public last** — Build public pages with real data already in DB
7. **SEO at the end** — Polish after all pages are working
